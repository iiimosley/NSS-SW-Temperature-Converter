# NSS JS Exercise - Temperature Converter

### Goals
* Research for applied logic
* Implement multiple inputs to determine output
* Multiple events for same functionality
* Javascript to manipulate DOM styles

### Directives
Convert a tempurature from Farenheit to Celcius and vice versa based on the user input:
* In the HTML, have one input field where someone can enter in a temperature.
* Create a radio button group where Celsius or Fahrenheit can be selected as the scale that the number should be converted to.
* Create a block level element that will hold the text of the converted temperature.
* Create a button that, when clicked, displays the converted temperature.
* Create another button that, when clicked, clears any text in the input field.
* Add an event handler to the input field that checks if the user pressed the enter key, and if that happens, perform the conversion.
* If the temperature is greater than 90F/32C the color of the converted temperature should be red.
* If the temperature is less than 32F/0C the color of the converted temperature should be blue.
* For any other temperature, the color should be green.
